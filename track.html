<h3>The Safety Net for Children with Diabetes in the US</h3>

The Children with Special Health Care Needs Program, funded through Title V of the Social Security Act of 1935, serves as a safety net for children with chronic diseases in the US, but the availability of coverage varies across states.  In 2006, we contacted Title V Programs in all 50 states to look at how coverage for children with diabetes varies across states.
