<h3>The Safety Net for Children with Diabetes in the US</h3>

This map displays the results of a study we performed to examine the safety net of healthcare coverage for children with diabetes in the United States.  This is a really important issue given that the overall burden of diabetes in children is rising in the U.S., and diabetes imposes a large financial burden on families who must manage the disease.
<p>
Title V programs for Children and Youth with Special Health Care Needs serve children with a variety of chronic diseases.  Every state has a Title V program, which can provide medical coverage and coordination of care for children, but the availability of coverage varies by diagnosis and state. In 2006, we contacted Title V Programs in all 50 states to examine whether children with  diabetes are covered by Title V programs and what types of services are covered.
<p>
We found that children with diabetes were eligible for Title V programs in just 32 states, which at a minimum would provide assistance with coordination of care for these children.  However, only twenty-six states (51%) provided medical coverage to pay for visits with health care professionals and medications like insulin.  Only 24 states also covered diabetes supplies (eg, glucometer strips, syringes).
The bottom line is that children who do not have access to a private health plan, and who do not qualify for income-based programs like Medicaid may not have access to the basic elements of care, simply based on geography.
<p>
The <span class="medical">dark blue</span> states provide medical coverage and coordination of care. This coverage varies by state. </br>
The <span class="coordination">light blue</span> states provide only coordination of care.</br>
The <span class="none">gray states</span> do not provide medical coverage or coordination of care.
